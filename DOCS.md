Use the Slack plugin to send a message to your Slack channel when a build completes.
You will need to supply Drone with an Incoming Webhook URL. You can create a new
Webhook URL here:
https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook

The following parameters are used to configuration the notification:

* **webhook_url** - json payloads are sent here
* **channel** - messages sent to the above webhook are posted here
* **username** - choose the username this integration will post as

The following is a sample Slack configuration in your .drone.yml file:

```yaml
notify:
  slack:
    webhook_url: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/...'
    username: 'drone'
    channel: '#general'
    on_started: false
    on_success: true
    on_failure: true
```
